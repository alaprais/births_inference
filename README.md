simple stan intro and comparison to classical approach


I had a conversation with my dad recently where he told me that many of the people he knew from a childhood town had been born on a Sunday. 

We went through the list of people and indeed the prevalence of Sunday was much higher than any other day. The sample size was small, so I was curious what a quick bayesian analysis would tell us about this surprising observations. I also wanted to compare/showcase the advantages of a bayesian approach over classical methods for this type of question.

What is afoot in this small-town in France? Check the code to find out.
